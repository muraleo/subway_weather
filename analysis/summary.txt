The goal of this project is to find the relationship between number of subway passenger and temperature, and find the
relationship between number of subway passenger and precipitation. In order to do this, the analysis method I use in 
this project is to calculate the correlation coefficient between every factor pairs. If the correlation coefficient is
near 1, it means the two factors have positive correlation. If the correlation coefficient is near -1, it means the two 
factors have negative correlation. If it near 0 means that the two factors has no correlation.

So there is the result, the correlation coefficient of passenger number and temperature is -0.5369738, which means that
passenger number and temperature have some negetive correlation, not so strong, but have negative correlation. It indicate
that when temperature goes high, there are less pessenger of subway, we can find that in virtualization. When temperature
goes low, more passengers choose to take subway.

The correlation coefficient of passenger number and precipitation is -0.01301567, which means that passenger number and precipitation have no correlation. It means that people will choose subway no matter rains or not.
